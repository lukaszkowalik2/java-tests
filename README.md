# Java Assignments - Test Suite

## Overview

This repository contains test cases for various Java assignments. You need to add these tests to your own Java project to verify your implementations. The repository provides only the test suite, so the actual functionality must be implemented by you.

## Instructions

1. **Integrate Tests into Your Project**:
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Copy the `test/` directory into your Java project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - You can paste your code into the assignment file and run the test file with the suffix *Test.java.

2. **Run Tests in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Right-click on the `test/` directory or a specific test class.
   - Select **Run 'All Tests'** to execute all tests and check your implementations.
   - You can also run individual test methods by clicking the green play icon next to them.
   - For detailed guidance on running tests in IntelliJ IDEA, refer to this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi67qUHbq-c).

## Notes

- Ensure that your project contains the necessary implementations in the `src/` directory to pass the provided tests.
- If a test fails, review your code and make corrections until all tests pass.
